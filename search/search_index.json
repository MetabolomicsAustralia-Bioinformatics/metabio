This is canonically done by fitting a straight line of best fit, in a linear regression, to samples with known concentrations and abundance values. New samples with known abundance values but unknown concentrations can then be computed via simple linear interpolation using this fitted linear model. MASTR-Quant is an open-source web application that allows users to calculate the concentration values of features in mass spectrometry data through visualizing and fitting calibration curves, based on a range of adjustable parameters, as well as instrument-related model-fitting options such as special treatment of internal standards, and background subtractions. The final output is downloadable as an Excel file with multiple sheets containing detailed results of the individual steps involved in the calculation process. MASTR-Quant is being served live here . Statement of Need MASTR-Quant provides an open-access, transparent way of calculating calibration curves, which would otherwise be inaccessible due to the need to utilize proprietary vendor software, which are usually only compatible with their respective mass spectrometry instruments as well. The methods used by MASTR-Quant are compatible across all vendors.
