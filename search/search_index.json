This is canonically done by fitting a straight line of best fit, in a linear regression, to samples with known concentrations and abundance values. New samples with known abundance values but unknown concentrations can then be computed via simple linear interpolation using this fitted linear model. MASTR-Quant is an open-source web application that allows users to calculate the concentration values of features in mass spectrometry data through visualizing and fitting calibration curves, based on a range of adjustable parameters, as well as instrument-related model-fitting options such as special treatment of internal standards, and background subtractions. The final output is downloadable as an Excel file with multiple sheets containing detailed results of the individual steps involved in the calculation process. MASTR-Quant is being served live here . Statement of Need MASTR-Quant provides an open-access, transparent way of calculating calibration curves, which would otherwise be inaccessible due to the need to utilize proprietary vendor software, which are usually only compatible with their respective mass spectrometry instruments as well. The methods used by MASTR-Quant are compatible across all vendors. Input Format MASTR-Quant accepts a table of abundance values in csv format. A sample template with dummy values is available from the home page. Note that: Column names should have no spaces in them. Standard samples are designated with S under the \" Group \" column Reagent blank samples are designated with R under the \" Group \" column Enter 0 in the \" std_replicate \" column if there are no replicates for Standards. Enter 0 in the \" Concentration \" column for all samples except the Standards. Enter 1 in the \" NF \" (normalising factor) if there are no external numerical measure to normalise to. Enter 1 if there is no dilution value. Name the internal standard columns in the format \"IS_(name_of_metabolite)\". Terminology Reagent Blank - a blank test sample which doesn't contain any study sample but has undergone the same treatment as your study sample. This test sample is necessary to verify that any positive response to your study sample is a result of the study sample itself and not any environmental effects from testing conditions, such as contaminants present in solvents or glassware. If you see a background signal from the reagent blank, this needs to be subtracted from the signal obtained in the the actual study samples to obtain accurate results. Internal Standards - An internal standard is a known concentration of metabolite that is added in a constant amount to every sample, reagents blanks and calibration standards that is analysed. This metabolite can be used to access the ratio of the analysed metabolite signal to its respective internal standard signal to correct for the loss of analyse during sample (metabolite) Extraction, storage and analysing instrumental variations. These ratios were used to obtain the metabolite concentration from a calibration curve. Dilution Factor - The ratio of the volume of the initial concentrated sample to the volume of the final diluted sample after extraction and before analysis. This ratio is necessary to calculate the initial absolute concentration of the compound present in the initial concentrated sample. Output Format The output is a single xlsx file containing the results of miscellaneous calculations: raw - Just the input data. CV - The coefficient of variation (CV) values of the abundances of each metabolite, presented by group. Con - The calculated concentration values based on the fitted linear regression model. Con_Dil - Calculated concentration values based on the fitted linear regression model, adjusted with the dilution factor. CV_Con - The coefficient of variation (CV) values of the concentrations of each metabolite, presented by group. Opt - Tab reporting selected options for linear regressions.
